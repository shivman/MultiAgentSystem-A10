1. **Initialize the system** using `youtube_demo_scripts.py`
2. **Test each demo** to ensure proper behavior
3. **Prepare human responses** for intervention scenarios
4. **Set up screen recording** with clear visibility

### Recording Tips for Each Demo
1. **Tool Failure Demos**: Show error messages clearly, demonstrate all 4 intervention options
2. **Step Failure Demos**: Show step counter reaching 3, demonstrate plan failure intervention
3. **Success Demos**: Show smooth execution without human intervention
4. **Mixed Demos**: Show both success and failure in the same query
5. **Document Demos**: Show document operations with failures and recovery
6. **Web Demos**: Show network failures and human workarounds
7. **Math Demos**: Show mathematical edge cases and human alternatives

### Human Intervention Response Examples

#### For Tool Failures:
- **Alternative Approach**: "Use 1 instead of 0 for division"
- **Manual Result**: "The square root of -1 is i (imaginary number)"
- **Skip Step**: "Skip the division step"
- **Retry with Parameters**: "Try dividing by 2 instead"

#### For Step Failures:
- **New Plan**: "Just calculate factorial of 5 and add 10"
- **Modify Plan**: "Combine the multiplication and addition into one step"
- **Direct Answer**: "The answer is 130"
- **Different Approach**: "Use a calculator approach instead"
